Over the course of the past year, I worked on CDPM project which involved data engineering, Java Development and Python development tasks.
I initially worked on to set up Kafka producer while using Schema Registry for data validation. As the project unfolded, I transitioned into Python development for a QA Automation framework, showcasing a keen ability to create and implement automated testing solutions. The robust QA framework contributed significantly contributed to the reliability and resilience of the applications we were developing.
Then I ventured into Java development, further enhancing my programming skills and contributing to the versatility of my role. This adaptability underscored my commitment to understanding and contributing to the project in a holistic manner. Beyond the technical realm, I took a proactive stance in problem-solving, identifying and resolving blockers promptly to ensure an uninterrupted workflow. This significantly contributed to the overall efficiency of the project.
Collaborating seamlessly across disciplines, I actively engaged in data engineering, Java development and Python development tasks as needed. This cross-functional collaboration created an environment to resolve issues in a collective manner. Timely task completion became a hallmark of my work, contributing to the overall efficiency of the project and aligning with our adherence to project timelines.
I actively embraced opportunities for learning, particularly in mastering cloud concepts and worked with Azure cloud for Application development. In summary, my contributions over the past year reflect a comprehensive and impactful journey, from data engineering to adaptable development, collaborative problem-solving, a diverse skill set, and a commitment to continuous learning.
